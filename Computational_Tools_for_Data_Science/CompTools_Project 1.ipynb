One of the reasons for this is, that several calculations can be done at once when using vectors, since the dot product between two vectors contain only the two entries with the same index, meaning the computer can calculate this product for several indices at the same time."

The function works much the same as the pandas one, the biggest difference is the mask. Here, we use a mask on an numpy array, which is quite a lot faster. Having to define, and then overwrite the whole column wastes a bit of time, but it is still 3x faster than the pandas version. "
